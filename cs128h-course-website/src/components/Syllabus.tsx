            <h4>Overview</h4>

            <h5>Introducing CS @ Illinois</h5>
            <p>
                CS 199-128 aims to build upon the topics covered in CS 128 by teaching students Rust, helping students develop practical programming skills, and helping students become engaged with the University of Illinois community.
            </p>

            <h5>Why Rust</h5>
            <p>
                Rust is a general purpose, multi-paradigm language that provides similar performance to C++ but with the added benefit of memory safety. We believe that Rust is poised to become a first-class language in the near future and will be an incredibly useful tool for any software engineer. In recent years, Rust has seen increased adoption in notable companies and large open-source projects, both in making new software and re-writing existing software to leverage on Rust’s memory safety.
            </p>

            <h5>Practical Programming Skills</h5>
            <p>
                Many students at UIUC, even CS majors, come in with little to no knowledge about programming. In this course, you will gain experience writing a lot of code to develop an intuition of what it means to solve problems programmatically. 
            </p>

            <p>
                CS 199-128 aims to bridge this gap by providing a fast-paced and rigorous environment where students are encouraged to develop technical skills.
            </p>

            <h5>Community</h5>
            <p>
                We aim to make the CS 199-128 learning environment one that not only is welcoming to students of all backgrounds but one that encourages those students to engage with their peers.
            </p>

            <h4>Class Structure</h4>

            <h5>Instructional Videos</h5>
            <p>
                Videos containing course content will be regularly uploaded to our YouTube page and on our website on Tuesdays and Thursdays. The first few weeks’ videos will be roughly 25 minutes per release day but require little outside classwork.
            </p>

            <p>
                We’ll answer questions about the lecture content live using the Discord server. If you have any questions please send them in the chat so everyone else can see the answer.
            </p>

            <p>
                While watching the lessons is technically not mandatory, you will struggle to succeed in the course without them. The homework assignments and machine problems (individual projects) are designed with the lessons in mind. We put great thought into them and highly encourage you to watch them.
            </p>

            <h5>Communication</h5>
            <p>
                We will be using Discord for all course-related communication. Students are expected to have joined the server since Discord will be used as our course forum and will be used to host office hours. Students may post questions about lectures, homework, machine problems, bugs, or anything else relevant to the course in the various channels on the server.
            </p>

            <h5>Homework</h5>
            <p>
                The specifics of the homework assignments are on Prairielearn.  Homework assignments are based on lecture content and work to solidify a concrete understanding of putting discussed topics into practice. We drop the lowest single homework grade at the end of the semester. Students should expect homework assignments to take around 30-45 minutes to complete. If you find yourself spending over an hour on homework, please reach out to a member of the course staff. Students will have around a week to complete homework assignments for full credit.
            </p>

            <h5>Machine Problems</h5>
            <p>
                Machine problems (MPs) are individual projects that students will complete over the course of the semester. While you may discuss machine problems at a high level with other students, you may not share code or divide work among multiple students. Students should expect to spend around 1.5-2 hours completing MP assignments. If you find yourself spending more than 4 hours on an MP, please contact a member of the course staff. Students will have around a week and a half to complete MP assignments for full credit.
            </p>

            <h5>Expected Weekly Time Commitment</h5>
            <ol>
