            <h4>Extension Policy</h4>

            <p>
                Homework and MP solution videos will be released the Wednesday after assignments are due. Students can submit assignments after the deadline for 70% credit up until a week after the original deadline.
            </p>

            <p>
            Late assignments will not be accepted outside of extreme circumstances. If students cannot complete a mandatory course obligation, they should notify Minh Phan (minhnp2@illinois.edu) or Quan Hao Ng (qhng2@illinois.edu) with a reason why. We generally accept excuses with evidence as provided by the <a href="https://studentcode.illinois.edu/article1/part5/1-501/">Student Code</a>.
            </p>

            <h4> Academic Integrity </h4>

            <p>
                We follow the same policy as most CS courses. High-level discussion is accepted (and encouraged), but all code must be the work of individual students. If you find yourself looking at someone elseâ€™s screen or typing on their keyboard, you are probably violating the academic integrity policy.
